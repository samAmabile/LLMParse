Damian Lillard won the 2024 NBA All-Star three-point contest.
Northern elephant seals can hold their breath for up to **100 minutes**.
Medea flees Athens in a dragon-drawn chariot, provided by her grandfather Helius, and goes to the city of **Athens**, where she is granted sanctuary by King Aegeus (as pre-arranged earlier in the play).
The prevailing wind in the tropics blows from **east to west**. These are known as the trade winds.
The brisket of beef comes from the **lower chest or breast section** of the cow.
Hyderabad and Secunderabad are often called "twin cities" because they grew into each other.
*   **Hyderabad** is the older, larger, and capital city of Telangana. It was historically the seat of the Nizams.
*   **Secunderabad** was originally established as a British cantonment town in the early 19th century, adjacent to Hyderabad.
Essentially, Secunderabad was a separate military and administrative area set up by the British next to the native state of Hyderabad. Today, they are functionally integrated into one large metropolitan area, but Secunderabad still retains its distinct railway station and some historical character.
The America's Cup went to catamarans in **2010 (33rd America's Cup)** for the first time. BMW Oracle Racing used a trimaran to win against Alinghi's catamaran.
The subsequent **2013 (34th America's Cup)** and **2017 (35th America's Cup)** editions also featured high-performance foiling catamarans (AC72 and AC50 classes, respectively).
It reverted to monohulls (AC75 class) for the 2021 and upcoming 2024 editions.
The story of *He Never Died* centers on **Jack (played by Henry Rollins)**, a world-weary, immortal, and deeply cynical man living a solitary, monotonous existence in a rundown urban apartment.
He's cursed with eternal life and an insatiable need to consume human flesh to sustain himself (though he tries to limit it to blood from a doctor or small portions). His quiet routine of bingo, diner meals, and avoiding human connection is shattered when his estranged teenage daughter, **Andrea**, suddenly appears on his doorstep.
Simultaneously, elements from his violent past resurface. A local gangster, **Alex**, who owes Jack money, comes looking for him, and soon Andrea becomes a target, kidnapped to force Jack's hand.
Reluctantly, Jack is forced to abandon his self-imposed detachment and unleash the brutal, superhuman violence he's tried to suppress. Throughout the film, it's revealed that Jack isn't just immortal; he is in fact **Cain from the Bible**, cursed by God to walk the Earth forever after murdering his brother Abel. This explains his inability to die and his unique dietary requirements.
He carves a bloody path through anyone who threatens Andrea or gets in his way, showcasing his instant healing and invulnerability. The film is a dark, violent, and surprisingly comedic exploration of existential dread, familial responsibility, and the burden of eternal life. By the end, Andrea is safe, but Jack remains eternally cursed, still walking the Earth, unchanged in his fundamental nature, but perhaps slightly more connected to humanity through his daughter.
In B.R. Chopra's iconic 1988 television series *Mahabharat*, the role of Krishna was played by **Nitish Bharadwaj**.
Old Major's role in *Animal Farm* is primarily that of the **ideological founder and inspirational catalyst** for the Animal Rebellion.
He is the venerable old boar who convenes the animals, delivers a powerful speech outlining the oppressive nature of humans, and introduces the concept of **Animalism** (a direct allegory for Communism). He shares his "dream" of a future where animals are free, equal, and self-governing, and teaches them the revolutionary song, "Beasts of England."
Crucially, Old Major dies just three nights after his speech, before the rebellion actually occurs. This makes him a **founding father figure** whose vision and teachings are later revered, distorted, and exploited by the pigs, particularly Napoleon and Squealer, to justify their own tyrannical rule.
In essence, he provides the **philosophical framework and the initial spark** that ignites the revolution, even though he never lives to see its implementation or subsequent corruption.
Bobby Ewing was primarily married to **Pamela Barnes Ewing** (played by Victoria Principal) in *Dallas*.
He also married April Stevens (played by Sheree J. Wilson) later in the series.
The role of Templeton "Faceman" Peck, or "Face," on *The A-Team* TV show was played by **Dirk Benedict**.
Tom Cruise's wife, Abby McDeere, in the movie *The Firm* was played by **Jeanne Tripplehorn**.
The band Linkin Park came from **Agoura Hills, California**.
There have been two main actors:
1.  **Jonathan Goldsmith** played "The Most Interesting Man in the World" from 2006 to 2016. He's the original and most famous one.
2.  **Augustin Legrand** took over the role from 2016 to 2018.
The US demanded trade with Japan primarily for three reasons, delivered with Commodore Matthew Perry's "black ships" in 1853-1854:
1.  **Economic Opportunity:** The US sought new markets for its goods and wanted access to Japan's resources. They also saw Japan as a crucial stopover on the lucrative trade route to China.
2.  **Coaling Stations and Supplies:** As steamships became more prevalent, the US needed coaling stations across the Pacific for its growing merchant and naval fleets. Japan's strategic location made it ideal for refueling and resupplying. American whaling ships also needed ports for supplies and repairs in the North Pacific.
3.  **Protection for Shipwrecked Sailors:** Japan's isolationist policy (Sakoku) meant that foreign sailors who washed ashore were often imprisoned, treated harshly, or killed. The US wanted a formal agreement to ensure the safe return and proper treatment of its citizens.
Essentially, the US wanted to break Japan's centuries-old isolation to further its own economic and strategic interests in the Pacific.
There hasn't been a "new season" of the original *Suits*. The show concluded its run with Season 9, which aired in **2019**.
While there's a new spin-off/offshoot in development (set in the same universe but with new characters and location), it's not a new season of the original series and has not started filming or airing yet.
The original and most famous version of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" was performed by **Frankie Valli** in **1967**.
In the context of BSA SLR Cycles, BSA stands for **Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited**.
The lyrics to "Let It Be" were written by **Paul McCartney**. While credited to the Lennon-McCartney partnership, it was primarily McCartney's composition.
The 2017 NFL season began on **Thursday, September 7, 2017**, with the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.
The idea of electric Christmas tree lights is generally credited to **Edward Johnson**.
He was a colleague and friend of Thomas Edison, and in **1882**, he was the first to publicly display a Christmas tree lit with 80 hand-blown, hand-painted electric light bulbs in his New York City home.
The reason "Water" isn't included in the band name Earth, Wind & Fire comes directly from **Maurice White**, the band's founder.
He was a **Sagittarius**, which is a **fire sign** in astrology. He specifically chose the elements Earth, Wind, and Fire because they resonated with his astrological chart and personal philosophy. He felt these three elements best represented the spiritual and dynamic nature he wanted for the band's music and message.
Brazil is different from every other South American country primarily because it is the **only one whose official language is Portuguese**.
All other South American countries officially speak Spanish (with the exception of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, which speak English, Dutch, and French, respectively). This linguistic distinction profoundly shaped its history, culture, and identity, setting it apart from its Spanish-speaking neighbors.
Mr. Rosso, the guidance counselor in *Freaks and Geeks*, is played by **Dave "Gruber" Allen**.
Mr. Merriweather on *I Love Lucy* was played by **Frank Nelson**.
The song "Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'be" (often shortened to "Fings Ain't What They Used To Be") was most famously sung by **Tommy Steele**. It was the title song from a successful 1959 British musical.
Hong Kong became part of China through a process involving historical treaties and a subsequent agreement for its return. Don't sugarcoat it:
1.  **British Acquisition:**
*   **Hong Kong Island:** Ceded to Britain in 1842 after the First Opium War via the Treaty of Nanking.
*   **Kowloon Peninsula (south of Boundary Street) and Stonecutters Island:** Ceded to Britain in 1860 after the Second Opium War via the Convention of Peking.
*   **New Territories:** Leased to Britain for 99 years in 1898 under the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. This area comprised the vast majority of the land.
2.  **The Lease Expiration & China's Stance:**
*   The 99-year lease for the New Territories was set to expire on **July 1, 1997**.
*   China (under the People's Republic of China) never recognized these "unequal treaties" as valid, asserting its sovereign right over the entire territory of Hong Kong.
*   As the expiration date approached, it was economically and infrastructurally impossible to return only the New Territories while retaining Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. The entire territory was inextricably linked.
3.  **The Handover Agreement:**
*   Following negotiations between the UK and China in the 1980s, the **Sino-British Joint Declaration** was signed in 1984.
*   This agreement stipulated that the **entire territory of Hong Kong** (Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) would be transferred back to China on **July 1, 1997**.
*   Under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, Hong Kong became a **Special Administrative Region (SAR)** of China, meant to retain a high degree of autonomy, its capitalist system, independent judiciary, common law, and existing freedoms for 50 years (until 2047).
So, Hong Kong became part of China because the 99-year lease on the New Territories expired, and China demanded the return of the entire territory, which the UK agreed to through a formal declaration.
In Blink-182's "I Miss You":
*   **Tom DeLonge** sings the primary lead vocals on the verses.
*   **Mark Hoppus** sings the distinct lead vocals on the bridge ("We can live like Jack and Sally...").
*   Both **Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus** share and harmonize on the choruses, with Hoppus taking lead on certain lines within the chorus, particularly the lower harmonies and lines like "don't waste your time on me..."
The Beatles played at The Cavern Club a total of **292 times**.
The "new approach" of affirmative action, largely centered on achieving **"diversity"** rather than solely remedying past discrimination, emerged prominently in the **late 1970s**.
This shift was solidified by the Supreme Court's ruling in **Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978**. While the Court struck down racial quotas, it held that race *could* be one factor in admissions decisions if it served the compelling state interest of creating a diverse student body.
Prior to Bakke, the rationale for affirmative action was more directly focused on overcoming the effects of systemic discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity. Bakke provided a new, constitutionally permissible legal justification that shaped affirmative action policies for decades.
The song "Stuck in the Middle" (correct title: "Stuck in the Middle With You") is sung by the Scottish band **Stealers Wheel**.
The artist who has won the most MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in one night is **Beyoncé**.
She won **8 VMAs** at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.
**Marie Curie** lost her life as a consequence of her own discoveries.
She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, discovering the elements polonium and radium. Her prolonged, unprotected exposure to these radioactive materials, which she handled extensively in her research, ultimately led to her death from aplastic anemia in 1934. At the time, the full dangers of radiation were not understood.
The fundamental purpose of recording instruments that affect real property is to **give public notice of ownership and other interests in the property**.
This public record:
*   **Establishes priority** among competing claims.
*   **Protects innocent purchasers** by allowing them to discover existing interests.
*   **Prevents fraud** by making ownership and encumbrances transparent.
There are **five** *Twilight* movies:
1.  Twilight
2.  The Twilight Saga: New Moon
3.  The Twilight Saga: Eclipse
4.  The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1
5.  The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2
*Cars 3* was released in the Philippines on **July 26, 2017**.
The head coach of the Chicago Bears is **Matt Eberflus**.
Ben Abbott became a judge on *Forged in Fire* because he was a **highly successful and popular contestant first**.
He won the competition three times before being invited to join the judging panel. His expertise, clear explanations, and ability to assess blades were recognized, leading to his transition from competitor to judge.
In the *Lethal Weapon* TV series, the role of Martin Riggs was played by **Clayne Crawford** for seasons 1 and 2.
After Crawford was fired, the character of Riggs was killed off, and Seann William Scott joined the cast in season 3 playing a new character, Wesley Cole.
In the fifth book of Harry Potter, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, **Sirius Black** dies.
The first Tesla Model 3 vehicles were delivered on **July 28, 2017**.
Rajon Rondo is currently **not playing for any team in the NBA**. He last played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2021-2022 season and is currently a free agent.
*The Haves and the Have Nots* has **concluded its run**.
The series finale aired on **July 20, 2021**. There are no new episodes or seasons coming back on.
Ben Wyatt (played by Adam Scott) first appears in *Parks and Recreation* in **Season 2, Episode 23, titled "The Master Plan."** He arrives with Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) to audit Pawnee's budget.
Chloe, the copy girl on *Friends* who Ross dates briefly, is played by **Angela Featherstone**.
Jerry Jacks stole Sam's baby (her son, Danny) in 2012. He kidnapped Danny and faked his death to manipulate Sam and John McBain.
In the 2003 live-action movie *The Cat in the Hat*, Sally Walden is played by **Dakota Fanning**.
The Statue of Liberty arrived in New York Harbor on **June 17, 1885**. It arrived in 350 individual pieces, packed into 214 crates, aboard the French frigate *Isère*.
In Missouri, you must be at least **19 years old** to obtain a concealed carry permit (endorsement).
However, it's important to note that Missouri is a permitless carry state for those 19 and older (or 18 and a member of the armed forces). This means that if you are legally able to possess a firearm, you can generally carry it concealed without a permit. The permit is still useful for reciprocity in other states.
The song "It's My Party and I'll Cry If I Want To" was famously sung by **Lesley Gore**.
While it saw a resurgence in popularity and was covered by artists in the 80s (like Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin), Lesley Gore's version was the massive original hit from **1963**, not the 80s.
"Isn't She Lovely" by Stevie Wonder is a celebration of the **birth of his daughter, Aisha Morris**.
He wrote the song specifically to express his joy and love for her shortly after she was born in 1975.
The first Anzac Day service in Australia was held in **Sydney, New South Wales**, on **April 25, 1916**.
While smaller commemorative services occurred in various places that day, the largest and most coordinated public commemoration with a march and a large gathering took place in Sydney.
The Star Trek universal translator is a sophisticated piece of fictional technology designed to instantly translate any language into the user's native tongue, and vice-versa.
Here's the general, often implied, understanding of how it works in the Star Trek universe, without sugarcoating:
1.  **Advanced Linguistic Analysis:** When an alien speaks, the translator doesn't just process sound waves. It's theorized to analyze the **neural patterns and brainwave activity** associated with the speaker's thoughts and intent, alongside the actual vocalizations. This allows it to grasp not just literal words but also context, nuance, and even underlying emotions.
2.  **Massive Database & AI:** It contains an immense database of known languages, linguistic structures, and cultural contexts. Coupled with advanced artificial intelligence, it can rapidly compare incoming data to its existing knowledge to decipher the language.
3.  **Real-Time Processing:** The translation happens almost instantaneously. It's often depicted as translating *before* the sound reaches the listener's ear, or overlaying the translation so seamlessly that the original language is not heard, only the translated version. This suggests some form of pre-emptive or simultaneous processing and projection.
4.  **Energy Fields (often subspace):** The actual projection of the translated language is often attributed to subtle **subspace fields or focused energy transmissions**. These fields would allow the translated audio to be directed directly into the listener's auditory cortex or ear, bypassing normal sound waves if necessary. This explains how it can work even when there's no visible speaker or earpiece.
5.  **Learning Capability:** For completely new languages, the translator requires an initial period of "listening" to build a linguistic model. The more data it receives, the more accurate its translations become, learning grammar, syntax, and vocabulary on the fly through complex algorithms.
Essentially, it's a hyper-advanced, AI-driven, multi-modal communication device that combines psycholinguistics, pattern recognition, and subtle energy manipulation to achieve seamless interspecies communication. It's the ultimate "magic wand" of Star Trek diplomacy.
In the movie *Are We There Yet?*, Chuck is played by **Owen C. Wilson**.
Exploration to the inner solar system began in **1959**.
The Soviet probe **Luna 1**, launched on January 2, 1959, was the first spacecraft to escape Earth's gravity and enter a heliocentric orbit, effectively becoming the first human-made object to travel through the inner solar system. While it was intended for a lunar impact (which it missed), its journey marked the beginning of robotic exploration beyond Earth's immediate vicinity.
The first successful planetary flyby (of Venus) was **Mariner 2** in 1962.
When a female has an extra X chromosome (meaning she has **XXX** instead of the usual XX), the condition is called **Triple X syndrome** (also known as Trisomy X).
Here's what happens:
*   **Often Subtle or Asymptomatic:** Many individuals with Triple X syndrome have very mild or no noticeable symptoms and may never be diagnosed.
*   **Physical Characteristics:**
*   **Taller than average height** is the most common physical feature.
*   Sometimes, subtle physical differences like widely spaced eyes or epicanthic folds can be present, but these are generally not distinct enough to be immediately recognized as a syndrome.
*   They typically have normal sexual development and are often fertile.
*   **Developmental and Cognitive Impacts:**
*   Increased risk of **developmental delays**, particularly in **speech and language**.
*   Higher incidence of **learning disabilities** (e.g., dyslexia) and difficulties with attention.
*   May have slightly lower average IQ scores compared to their siblings, though IQ usually falls within the normal range.
*   Increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD.
*   **Variability:** The severity of these characteristics varies greatly among individuals. Some girls and women with Triple X lead completely typical lives with no significant challenges, while others may require support for learning or developmental issues.
In summary, it generally leads to a female who is taller than average, with an increased risk for learning and speech delays, but often with normal physical and sexual development, and a significant percentage are never even diagnosed.
The following Central American republics gained independence from Spain:
*   **Costa Rica**
*   **El Salvador**
*   **Guatemala**
*   **Honduras**
*   **Nicaragua**
They collectively declared independence from Spain on September 15, 1821, initially forming the Federal Republic of Central America before becoming separate nations.
**Panama** is a special case: it gained independence from Spain in 1821, then joined Gran Colombia, and later gained independence from Colombia in 1903 with US backing.
No, not entirely in the way you might imagine a traditional onion ring.
Burger King's onion rings are made from **diced or minced onion pieces** that are processed and then reformed into rings before being battered and fried. They do contain actual onion, but they aren't typically made from whole, sliced onion rings.
The 1983 "A Nation at Risk" report was a **landmark, stark, and highly influential document** that fundamentally reshaped the discourse and direction of American education for decades.
Don't sugarcoat it, its significance was:
1.  **Alarming Wake-Up Call:** It famously warned of a "rising tide of mediocrity" in American schools, declaring that the nation's educational system was failing so severely that it threatened the country's economic competitiveness and national security. This created a sense of national crisis and urgency.
2.  **Shifted the Education Debate:** It moved the conversation away from issues of equity and access (prominent in the civil rights era) towards concerns about quality, rigor, and the need for higher standards. Education was reframed as a crucial component of economic survival and global competitiveness.
3.  **Catalyst for Reform:** The report directly spurred a wave of state and federal education reforms. These included:
*   Calls for a more rigorous curriculum (the "New Basics": English, math, science, social studies, computer science).
*   Increased academic standards and expectations for students.
*   Longer school days and school years.
*   Improved teacher training, higher salaries, and more rigorous evaluation.
*   Emphasis on standardized testing and accountability.
4.  **Influenced Future Policy:** Its recommendations laid the philosophical groundwork for subsequent major federal education initiatives, most notably the **No Child Left Behind Act of 2002** and the **Race to the Top initiative**, both of which heavily emphasized accountability, standardized testing, and data-driven reform.
In essence, "A Nation at Risk" was a powerful, politically charged indictment of American schooling that successfully forced a national reckoning with educational quality and set the agenda for education reform for the next 30-40 years.
The Great East Japan Earthquake (and subsequent tsunami) struck Japan on **March 11, 2011**.
In *Once Upon a Time*, Kristoff is played by **Scott Michael Foster**.
The prominent female backup singer on The Babys' "Every Time I Think of You" is **Myrna Smith**.
She was a former member of The Sweet Inspirations, who were famously Elvis Presley's backing vocalists.
Eric Forman (Topher Grace) is not in season 8 of *That '70s Show* because **Topher Grace chose to leave the show** to pursue a film career.
He wanted to focus on movies like *Spider-Man 3* and *In Good Company*. His character was written out by having Eric go to Africa to teach.
The walls of the atria (specifically the cardiac muscle cells in the atria) produce **atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)**, also known as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF).
Columbia became the capital of South Carolina in **1786**.
*Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel* has **concluded its run**.
The final episode of *Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel* aired on **December 8, 2018**. There are no returns or new episodes for that specific season.
In computer science, an **interpreter** is a program that **executes code directly, line by line**, without first compiling the entire program into machine code.
Don't sugarcoat it:
*   It reads a statement from the source code.
*   It immediately translates and executes that single statement.
*   It then moves to the next statement, repeating the process.
This is in contrast to a **compiler**, which translates the *entire* source code into an executable machine code file *before* any part of the program can run.
**Key characteristics of an interpreter:**
*   **No separate compilation step:** Code runs directly from its source form.
*   **Slower execution:** Because each line is translated and executed on the fly, interpreted programs generally run slower than compiled programs.
*   **Easier debugging:** Errors can be detected and reported as they are encountered, often pointing to the exact line.
*   **Platform independence (often):** If an interpreter is available for a given platform, the same source code can run on it without recompilation.
Think of it like this: A compiler is like translating an entire book into another language before anyone reads it. An interpreter is like a simultaneous translator, translating sentence by sentence as someone speaks.
Carrie Mathison finds out she was right about Brody being involved with Abu Nazir in **Season 1, Episode 12, "The Weekend,"** which is the season finale.
She pieces together the evidence and realizes he's part of the plot, though it's still unfolding. However, a more definitive confirmation of his full complicity and her vindication in the eyes of others comes in **Season 2**. She knows by the end of Season 1.
Pakistan was a part of **British India** before it became independent.
The Great Ocean Road officially starts in **Torquay, Victoria** and ends in **Allansford, Victoria**.
The Speaker of the House is chosen by the **members of the House of Representatives themselves**.
Here's the breakdown:
1.  **Elected by the House:** The Speaker is elected by a majority vote of the Representatives at the beginning of each new Congress (every two years).
2.  **Majority Party's Nominee:** By tradition and practical reality, the Speaker is almost always the **leader of the majority party** in the House. The majority party caucuses beforehand to select their nominee, and because they hold the majority of votes, their candidate virtually always wins.
3.  **Does Not Have to Be a Member:** While almost always a sitting Representative, the Constitution does *not* technically require the Speaker to be an elected member of the House. However, no non-member has ever been elected Speaker.
4.  **Second in Line for Presidency:** The Speaker is second in the line of succession to the presidency, after the Vice President.
So, it's essentially a political process: the party that wins the most seats in the House gets to pick their leader to be Speaker, and then the full House formally votes them in.
The school of Functionalism in psychology was primarily founded by **William James**.
Its primary beliefs revolved around understanding the **purpose and function of mental processes and behavior**, rather than just their structure.
Key tenets included:
*   **Adaptive Value:** Mental states and behaviors exist because they serve an adaptive purpose, helping an organism survive and thrive in its environment. This was heavily influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution.
*   **Focus on 'Why':** Functionalists were interested in *why* the mind works the way it does, *what its purpose is*, and *how it aids adjustment to the environment*, contrasting with Structuralism's focus on 'what' the mind is made of.
*   **Holistic View:** They viewed the mind and consciousness as a continuous, flowing process (James's "stream of consciousness"), rather than a collection of discrete elements.
*   **Practical Application:** Emphasized the application of psychology to real-world problems, such as education and abnormal behavior.
*   **Eclectic Methods:** Utilized a broader range of research methods beyond introspection, including observation of behavior, animal studies, and studies of individual differences.
Smokey Bear has had several voice actors over the decades.
There isn't one single, consistent voice. Historically, some of the most prominent voice actors have included:
*   **Jackson Weaver** (for over 40 years, from 1952 until his death in 1992, arguably the most iconic voice)
*   **Jack Angel**
*   **Roger C. Carmel**
*   **James B. Douglas**
*   **Sam Elliott** (known for his distinct deep voice, he voiced Smokey in more recent campaigns)
*   **Frank Welker** (a prolific voice actor, also provided the voice)
So, it's not one person, but a succession of actors. **Sam Elliott** is one of the more recognizable recent voices.
Santa's reindeer are traditionally named:
1.  Dasher
2.  Dancer
3.  Prancer
4.  Vixen
5.  Comet
6.  Cupid
7.  Donner (sometimes Dunder)
8.  Blitzen (sometimes Blixem)
9.  Rudolph (the most famous, though added later)
The **original Air Jordan 4** first released in **1989**.
"Retro 4s" refer to the numerous re-releases of that original model, and new colorways and versions of the Air Jordan 4 are released frequently, so there isn't a single "come out" date for all Retro 4s.
Humanism was an **intellectual and cultural movement** that originated in the Renaissance (roughly 14th to 16th centuries). It marked a profound shift from a predominantly God-centered, otherworldly medieval worldview to one that emphasized **human potential, achievement, and value**.
Don't sugarcoat it, its primary beliefs were:
*   **Dignity of Man:** A belief in the inherent worth and capacity for greatness in individual human beings.
*   **Emphasis on Reason and Critical Inquiry:** Encouraged the use of human intellect and observation to understand the world, rather than relying solely on dogma or supernatural explanations.
*   **Revival of Classical Antiquity:** A passionate study and admiration for the literature, philosophy, and art of ancient Greece and Rome, believing these classical texts held wisdom for human living.
*   **Focus on the Humanities:** Elevated subjects like grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy (the "studia humanitatis") as crucial for a well-rounded and virtuous life.
*   **Civic Virtue and Active Life:** Encouraged active participation in civic life and the pursuit of excellence in all human endeavors, rather than solely focusing on monastic or ascetic spiritual pursuits.
Humanism had a lasting and foundational impact on Europe:
1.  **Educational Revolution:** It revolutionized education by shifting the curriculum from purely theological and scholastic training to the liberal arts, fostering critical thinking, eloquence, and a broader understanding of human experience. This laid the groundwork for modern secular education.
2.  **Artistic and Cultural Transformation:** It fueled the Renaissance in art and literature, inspiring artists to depict the human form with unprecedented realism, explore human emotion, and celebrate individual achievement. Works like Michelangelo's David or Leonardo's Vitruvian Man are direct expressions of humanist ideals.
3.  **Religious Reform and Individualism:** While not anti-religious, humanism encouraged a more personal and critical approach to scripture and church authority. Scholars like Erasmus applied humanist textual analysis to the Bible, which significantly contributed to the intellectual climate that led to the Protestant Reformation, emphasizing individual faith over institutional mediation.
4.  **Political and Social Thought:** It fostered civic humanism, promoting active participation in government and public service. It also laid intellectual groundwork for later political philosophies that would emphasize individual rights, liberty, and self-governance, moving away from purely divine right justifications for power.
5.  **Foundation for Scientific Inquiry:** By emphasizing observation, critical thought, and questioning established authority, humanism created an intellectual environment conducive to the Scientific Revolution. It encouraged scholars to study the natural world directly, rather than solely through medieval interpretations of ancient texts.
In essence, Humanism pulled Europe out of its medieval intellectual confines, placing **humanity, reason, and empirical observation** at the center of inquiry. This fundamental shift influenced nearly every aspect of European society, culture, and governance, creating the conditions for the Enlightenment and the modern era.
The name of the Russian national anthem is "**State Anthem of the Russian Federation**" (Государственный гимн Российской Федерации, Gosudarstvenny gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii).
It uses the same melody as the Soviet national anthem but with new lyrics.
The Rolling Stones had several notable opening acts during their 1981 "Tattoo You" American Tour, and they varied by location and date.
Some of the most prominent acts that opened for them included:
*   **George Thorogood & The Destroyers**
*   **Journey**
*   **The J. Geils Band**
*   **Santana**
*   **Prince** (famously, though his opening sets were not always well-received by the Stones' rock audience at the time)
The song "California Dreamin'" by The Mamas & the Papas has been featured in many movies. Here are some of the most notable:
*   **Forrest Gump** (1994)
*   **Chungking Express** (1994)
*   **The Mamas & the Papas: California Dreamin'** (2005) - a documentary, but it's central
*   **Happy Feet Two** (2011)
*   **San Andreas** (2015)
*   **Kong: Skull Island** (2017)
It's a very popular song for movie soundtracks, so this isn't an exhaustive list, but these are some of the prominent ones.
The North Face operates **over 200 stores worldwide**.
This number includes full-price stores, outlet stores, and partner stores. It's a dynamic number as new stores open and some close, but "over 200" is a solid current estimate.
The term "rock and roll" was first popularized and widely used by Cleveland disc jockey **Alan Freed** in the early 1950s.
He started using it on his radio show, "Moondog Rock and Roll Party," in **1951** or **1952** (sources vary slightly on the exact year he started consistently using it on air). He used it to describe the rhythm and blues music he was playing, which was then largely unknown to a wider white audience.
While the phrase "rock and roll" had appeared in blues and spiritual music for decades prior (often as a euphemism for sex), Freed was instrumental in applying it to a *genre of music* and bringing it into mainstream consciousness.
The three-point line was implemented in different leagues at different times:
*   **American Basketball Association (ABA):** The ABA was the first major professional league to introduce the three-point line in its inaugural season, **1967-68**.
*   **National Basketball Association (NBA):** The NBA adopted the three-point line for the **1979-80 season**.
*   **NCAA (College Basketball):** The NCAA first experimented with it in 1986 and officially adopted a consistent three-point line for the **1986-87 season**.
The greatest resistance to airflow would be found at the **narrowest point or most constricted section** of a flow path.
This is where the cross-sectional area for the air to move through is minimized, forcing the air to accelerate and experience more friction and/or turbulence against the walls of the conduit or around an obstruction.
Think of it:
*   **A tiny crack** compared to a wide-open door.
*   **A clogged filter** compared to a clean one.
*   **A small nozzle** on a hose compared to the wide hose itself.
In the human respiratory system, for example, the greatest resistance to airflow is typically found in the **medium-sized bronchi**, not the smallest individual airways, due to a combination of their diameter and the collective geometry of the branching tree.
The Luminous Mysteries were added to the Rosary by **Pope John Paul II** in **2002**.
He introduced them in his Apostolic Letter, *Rosarium Virginis Mariae*, on October 16, 2002.
The needle for a spinal block is generally **very thin but long**.
*   **Gauge:** Typical gauges range from **22 gauge (larger diameter) down to 27 gauge or even 29 gauge (very fine)**. A common size is often around **25 or 27 gauge**. (Remember, higher gauge number means a thinner needle).
*   **Length:** The length varies depending on the patient's anatomy, but they are typically between **3.5 inches (9 cm) to 5 inches (12.5 cm)** long, and sometimes even longer for larger patients, to reach the spinal canal.
*   **Tip Design:** Many spinal needles have a specialized non-cutting, **pencil-point tip** (like a Sprotte or Whitacre needle) rather than a sharp bevel. This design is intended to spread rather than cut the dura, reducing the risk of a post-dural puncture headache.
The initial skin prick is usually the sharpest part. After that, patients typically feel pressure as the needle advances, rather than a sharp pain, as the aim is to thread it between vertebrae into the spinal fluid space.
*Beauty and the Beast* (2017) was primarily filmed at **Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England**.
Much of the village, castle interiors, and elaborate sets were constructed on soundstages there. Some exterior shots and landscapes were captured in various locations in the UK and then enhanced with CGI.
Olivia Pope is a **crisis manager and "fixer"** for the political elite and powerful individuals in Washington D.C.
She runs her own firm, **Olivia Pope & Associates (later Pope & Associates)**, which specializes in making high-profile scandals, legal issues, and PR nightmares disappear. Her job involves everything from manipulating the media and evidence to negotiating with powerful figures, all to protect her clients' reputations and careers.
In essence, she handles dirty laundry for the powerful.
Angela's baby, Philip Halsted Schrute, on *The Office* is **Dwight Schrute's biological child**.
Although she initially tries to pass him off as the child of her husband, Robert Lipton (a state senator), a paternity test (albeit a tricky one designed by Dwight) later confirms Dwight is the father.
**Fun. has not announced any plans for a new album, and it's highly unlikely they will release one.**
The band went on an **indefinite hiatus in 2015**. While the members haven't explicitly said they've broken up, they've all moved on to solo projects (Nate Ruess released *Grand Romantic*, Jack Antonoff is highly successful with Bleachers and as a producer, and Andrew Dost works on various projects).
So, don't expect a new Fun. album.
TRICARE provides accident and health coverage to **uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide**.
This specifically includes:
*   **Active duty service members**
*   **Retired service members**
*   **National Guard and Reserve members** (under certain circumstances)
*   **Family members** of all the above (spouses and children)
*   **Survivors** (eligible family members of deceased service members or retirees)
*   **Medal of Honor recipients** and their families
Essentially, it's the healthcare program for the United States military community.
The Detroit Red Wings name comes from its original owner and general manager, **James E. Norris**, in **1932**.
Norris purchased the team (then known as the Detroit Falcons) and renamed them the "Red Wings" as a tribute to his former amateur hockey club, the **Montreal Winged Wheelers**.
The "winged wheel" motif itself symbolized **speed and industry**, a nod to Detroit's automotive manufacturing heritage. So, the name is a direct homage to a prior team owned by Norris, with an underlying connection to Detroit's industrial identity.
Patillas, Puerto Rico is located on the **southeastern coast of Puerto Rico**.
It borders the Caribbean Sea to the south, and the municipalities of San Lorenzo to the north, Yabucoa to the east, and Maunabo and Arroyo to the west.
The character "Sunshine" in the movie *Harlem Nights* was played by **Della Reese**.
A substance that causes an allergic reaction (an allergen) triggers the release of a class of substances known as **histamines** (and other inflammatory mediators like leukotrienes and prostaglandins).
Histamines are the primary culprits behind most allergic symptoms.
In the 2006 movie *Casino Royale*, James Bond is primarily playing **Texas Hold'em poker**.
The Chernobyl Power Plant did not go offline all at once immediately after the infamous accident.
*   **Reactor 4** was destroyed and went offline on **April 26, 1986**, due to the explosion.
*   The remaining reactors (1, 2, and 3) were progressively shut down over the years:
*   **Reactor 2** went offline in **1991** after a fire in the turbine hall.
*   **Reactor 1** went offline in **1996**.
*   **Reactor 3** was the last operational reactor and went offline on **December 15, 2000**, marking the complete shutdown of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
Angela Montenegro's real name in *Bones* is **Angela Pescadero**.
Her full name at birth was Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro Pescadero, as her father, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, decided to change her name at one point, but then revealed her original birth name to be Pescadero.
Potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) is a versatile chemical due to its powerful **oxidizing properties**.
Here are its primary chemical applications, without sugarcoating:
1.  **Water Treatment:**
*   **Oxidizes Iron & Manganese:** Used to remove dissolved iron (Fe²⁺) and manganese (Mn²⁺) from water by oxidizing them into insoluble precipitates (Fe(OH)₃ and MnO₂) that can then be filtered out.
*   **Controls Taste & Odor:** Oxidizes organic compounds that cause unpleasant tastes, odors (like hydrogen sulfide "rotten egg" smell), and colors in water.
*   **Algae Control:** Acts as an algicide.
2.  **Antiseptic & Disinfectant:**
*   **Medical/Dermatological:** Dilute solutions are used as an antiseptic for wounds, eczema, fungal infections (like athlete's foot), and dermatitis due to its ability to kill bacteria and fungi through oxidation.
*   **Aquaculture:** Used to treat certain parasitic infections in fish and to oxidize organic matter in ponds.
3.  **Organic Synthesis & Industrial Chemistry:**
*   **Oxidizing Agent:** A common reagent in organic chemistry for oxidizing various functional groups:
*   Primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.
*   Secondary alcohols to ketones.
*   Alkenes to diols (under mild conditions) or for oxidative cleavage (under harsher conditions).
*   Alkyl side chains of aromatic compounds.
*   **Bleaching:** Used in some industrial bleaching processes for textiles, paper, and leather.
*   **Etching:** Used as an etching agent in printed circuit board manufacturing.
4.  **Analytical Chemistry:**
*   **Redox Titrations (Permanganometry):** Widely used as a self-indicating titrant to determine the concentration of various reducing agents (e.g., iron(II), oxalates, peroxides) in a sample, as the purple MnO₄⁻ ion is reduced to the colorless Mn²⁺ ion.
In essence, its ability to aggressively accept electrons makes it a potent tool for breaking down, sterilizing, purifying, and transforming other substances.
The Miracle of Lanciano is believed to have taken place in the **8th century AD**, specifically around **700 AD** or slightly later.
