23: 1117: In summary, for both heat and electricity, the core property of a good insulator is its inability to easily transfer energy (whether kinetic/vibrational energy as heat, or electrical potential energy as current) due to the lack of freely moving particles or efficient energy transfer mechanisms within its structure.
